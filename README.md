# SSRF-lab

In this Lab, there are four types of defense mechanisms available to developers for addressing the SSRF issue. However, each of these mitigations can be bypassed by more sophisticated techniques. The bypass methods range from basic encoding of private IP addresses to advanced techniques such as DNS rebinding or Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)

**PS: Note that this laboratory is currently a work in progress.**
